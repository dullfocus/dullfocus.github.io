## Day 2

### Mood

* 6:44 a.m. - something more like a 4.5 , not that it's bad but you know
* 1:31 p.m. - more like a 7.5, beautiful sunny walk, not that cold

### Thoughts

- 4:29 p.m.
  - filled in the moods retoractively, sue me 
  - moderately productive day, got the finance stuff done, tested reenrol, surprising amount of meetings, etc
  - proactive advising also in prod as well, nice 
  - temper still fairly short, actually
  - final exams stuff out too, nice

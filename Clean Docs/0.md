## Day 0

### Mood 

â€‹	7 out of 10 I guess	

### Thoughts

- booze owns, it's like a weighted blanket on my brain 
- serotonin ahoy bay bee
- honestly not that fussed about the next 32 days 
- thinking about making ginger beer? honestly that could whip since the the second attraction to beer (post serotonin) is novelty 
- a note that my temper is pretty volatile at this current moment
- huge urge to reread T.S. Eliot
  - Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light, the silence.

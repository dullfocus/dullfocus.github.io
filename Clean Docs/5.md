## Day 5

#### _as inside so outside_ 

I've let this get away from me; I've let complacency seep in; I've let commonness seep in. We should look good, we should be sharp at all times, we should have an applied focus, we should make ourselves greater, we should not err on the side of mercy

it is unclear if the booze has kept this suppressed. I'm going with no; this is a lesson learned because of ~~Nadika~~.

### Mood 

* 6:42 a.m. 2.5 for sure, gonna be a bad one today folx
* 10:53 a.m. 4.5 . We're getting there bay bee but I keep perseverating on how shitty all of this fucking shit is and it keeps pulling me back. Still bear is asleep and I am Committed to a Course of Action (a mind like mine)

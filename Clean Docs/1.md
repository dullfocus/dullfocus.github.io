## Day 1

### Mood

* 8:35 a.m. - honestly like an 8.5 or 9 

### Thoughts

- 8:37 a.m.
  - was actually kind of a mess yesterday in retrospect
  - should definitely make ginger beer, good call
  - maybe pull the trigger on doing nightly exercise as well to replace/distract?
  - kind of stoked to see what happens physically tbh
